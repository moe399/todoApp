Live Link: https://todo-p5iyyli9n-moe399s-projects.vercel.app/

This project is a simple Todo application with a landing page, built using Next.js for the frontend and Pocketbase as the backend. The app demonstrates various features such as CRUD operations, React Context, React Hook Form, and more.

## Features

-   **Landing Page**: An attractive landing page to introduce the app.
-   **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks.
-   **React Context**: State management using React Context API.
-   **React Hook Form**: Handling form inputs and validations.
-   **Pocketbase**: Backend service for storing and managing todo items.


I aim to rewrite the backend in Java spring boot, which will have more features such as shareable todos.

## Learnings

Throughout this project, I have learned and implemented:

-   CRUD operations with Pocketbase
-   State management with React Context API
-   Form handling with React Hook Form
